This mechanism ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, with prices serving as signals to producers and consumers about the relative scarcity of goods and services."

This illustrates a holistic approach to understanding the brain.-Kohler placed hungry chimp Sultan in a cage with a bunch of bananas out of reach outside. Two hollow bamboo sticks were inside the cage: neither stick alone could reach them but joined, they could. cage. After a while Sultan started playing with the sticks and accidentally one of the sticks went into the hollow end of the other. He then used the two sticks to form a longer stick, and with its help pulled the banana inside the cage. This illustrates a holistic view of learning =\"insight learning\" has occurred when the chimp solved the problem viewing all of the components of the problem together, allowing their emergent properties to become apparent."
