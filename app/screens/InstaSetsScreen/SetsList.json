While empirical research, gathered through observations and surveys, is crucial, outcomes can vary significantly across different researchers, time periods, and cultures. Refutation, on the other hand, based on empirical evidence, helps determine the validity of economic statements. Economists develop models to simplify reality after repeated testing of hypotheses, relying on assumptions about behaviour and outcomes. These assumptions are essential to account for complex human behaviour and changing variables. When evaluating models, it's crucial to consider the underlying assumptions."

This means that doubt is cast on the assumption that animal aggression is made up of adaptive rituals e.g. Jane Goodall studied chips in Tanzania and observed a \"4 year war\", where chimps attempted to systematically slaughter those of another community in a coordinated, premeditated fashion e.g. holding individuals down and biting/hitting for up to 20 mins in spite of appeasement signals...X Evidence for the ethological explanation comes from animals = the evidence found may not generalise to more cognitively complex species such as humans. E.g. aggression in humans is less likely a result of IRMs and FAPs as shown in the wide ranging and subtle variations in situations which trigger human aggression such as by Nisbett who found a north-south divide in the US in homicide rates amongst white males, with southern males being more likely to kill another man if their \"honour\" had been insulted..."

Those children who were in a group and anonymous were the group who stole the most at 57%, compared to 21% in the group that were identifiable/ alone but anonymous. 8% stole when identified and alone. =in a group, children are more likely to behave in a socially deviant way, therefore supporting deindividuation theory as a social psychological theory of aggression.Zimbardo: Female undergrads divided into 2 groups. Group 1 with large name tags to wear and could see each other during the study. Group 2 in loose fitting lab coats, hoods over faces and were kept away from other Ps during the study. All Ps were asked to observe a woman (a confederate) being interviewed, and to evaluate her performance. Half the time, the interviewee was a mild mannered pleasant woman, and half the time she was rude and obnoxious. \"Evaluation\"= administering (fake) electric shocks. Group 1 shocked the rude interviewee more than the pleasant interviewee.
